This repository is designed to help other project members develop, test, and contribute to the openstack.org website project. Note that this project is only for the public openstack.org website and content. To participate in building the actual OpenStack software, go to:

WHAT'S INCLUDED
Included in this repository are the custom page types and theme assets that customize Silverstripe for http://www.openstack.org/


REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPLOYING OPENSTACK.ORG

To run the openstack.org website, the server environment needs:
- Apache 1.3 or greater
- PHP 5.2.0 or greater
- MySQL 5.0 or greater

Additionally, these items must be installed at the web root:
- Silverstripe 2.4
- The dataobject_manager module

Last, implement these customizations:
- Place the openstack folder in the webroot
- Place themes/openstack from this repository in /themes/openstack

TODO:
We need a way to provide a clean and current dump of the database, since a majority of the web content for the site is stored there. Also, we need detailed installation instructions to run the site locally on LAMP or MAMP.
